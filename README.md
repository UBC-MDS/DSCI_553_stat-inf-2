## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Use Bayesian reasoning when modeling data.
2. Apply Bayesian statistics to regression models.
3. Compare and contrast Bayesian and frequentist methods, and evaluate their relative strengths.
4. Use appropriate statistical libraries and packages for performing Bayesian inference
